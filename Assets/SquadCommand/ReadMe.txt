Squad Command: Advanced Warfighter AI
-------------------------------------
Thank you for purchasing Squad Command: Advanced Warfighter AI from Rival Theory.

When running the scene, press Space to start playing and for instructions.  Press V to switch camera views.

This project includes everything you need to get started creating tactical shooter games with AI.  There are 4 sample scenes to look at:

1) Patrol: This is the main scene that demonstrates
-- Formations.  Run the scene to see how soldiers join the formation harness of a commander.  Tweak settings on the Column harness of the Commander to create different formations.
-- Patrolling.  Look at the Commander and Soldier behavior trees, and at the Default Patrol behavior tree to see how AI patrol and follow a waypoint path.
-- Basic fighting.  The Default Attack behavior does most of the work.  Follow the custom actions in the behavior tree to see how choosing a fighting location or a cover point happens.  Check the AI Rig of any soldier and look at the included scripts to see how aiming and weapon firing is done.
-- Squad formations.  As the Player, you can issue commands to your squad members.  Check the Attacker behavior tree to see how issued commands become AI behaviors.
-- Communication.  Look at the Default Patrol behavior tree to see how AI notify their team when enemies are spotted.
-- Cover and threats.  Look at the Cover and Threat positions, and see how AI sensors can be used to detect and take advantage of tactical information.

2) Sniper: Based on the patrol scene, this scene adds snipers that fire from a building.  
-- Health.  Each AI has a Health Element that manages damage and health.  Check the differences between Sniper health and regular soldier health.  Consider increasing the Player health to make the game more survivable.  Also, notice how the Health Element works with the Communication System to send threat information to team members.
-- Aiming and Firing.  Look at the Accuracy setting on the AimAndFireElement of each AI.  Increasing the value will decrease shooting accuracy.  Consider increasing this on enemy AI to make the game more survivable.

3) Spawner: Based on the patrol scene, this scene shows how you can spawn new enemies into your scene.
-- Spawner.  Check the Spawner script and the Spawner element in the scene to see how easy it is to spawn new enemies.

4) Big Team Battle: See how large formations can be organized in this scene.
-- Team Element.  Look at the Team Element on each AI and see how Aspects are added so that sensors can detect which Team an AI or player is on.


Fully commented script code is available for all AI behaviors, AI custom elements, UI, player control, etc.
